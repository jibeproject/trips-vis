## Setup
```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(sf)
require(gt)

# Change the path as needed, currently set to Manchester folder

zone <- st_read("synpop/sp_2021/OA_2021_MCR.shp")

trips_ref <- read.csv("simulationResults/ForUrbanTransition/reference/travel_demand_mito/trips.csv")

trips_cint <- read.csv("simulationResults/ForUrbanTransition/cycleIntervention/travel_demand_mito/trips.csv")

pp <- read.csv("synpop/sp_2021/pp_2021.csv")
```

## Data Preparation

```{r}

trips_ref <- trips_ref %>% 
  mutate(scenario = "Reference")

trips_cint <- trips_cint %>% 
  mutate(scenario = "Cycling intervention")

trips <- bind_rows(trips_ref, trips_cint)

## Creating Visualizations

### Table of the number of trips in each local authority in Greater Manchester

```{r}

  group_by(location) %>%
  summarise(trip_count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(percent_of_total = (trip_count / sum(trip_count)))

t1 <- trip_counts %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Trips by Location",
    subtitle = "Sum of trips within each Local Authority District"

    percent_of_total = "Percent of Total"
  ) %>% 
  fmt_percent(
    columns = percent_of_total,
    decimals = 1
  )
